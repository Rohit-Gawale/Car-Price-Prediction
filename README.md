##   Car Price Prediction Module: Data Analysis and Machine Learning in Python

- Project Description
  The Car Price Prediction Module is a data analysis and machine learning project aimed at accurately predicting the price of cars based on their various characteristics. 
  This project leverages Pythonâ€™s data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning libraries to preprocess the data, select relevant features, and build predictive 
  models.
 
- Project Goals
  Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the raw data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
  Feature Selection: Identify and select the most relevant features for predicting car prices.
  Model Training: Utilize various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
  Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric.
  Prediction and Submission: Generate predictions for the test dataset and prepare a submission file.
  Key Steps and Methods
  Data Loading and Exploration:

- Explore the datasets to understand their structure and the types of features available.
  Data Preprocessing:

  Replace infinite values with NaN and fill missing values with appropriate strategies (e.g., mean imputation).
  Encode categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
  Align the training and test datasets to ensure they have the same features.

- Feature Selection:

  Perform correlation analysis and use domain knowledge to select features.
  Optionally, use feature importance from preliminary models to guide the selection process.
  Model Training and Evaluation:

- Split the training data into training and validation sets.
  Train various machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) on the training set.
  Evaluate the models on the validation set using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric.
  Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
